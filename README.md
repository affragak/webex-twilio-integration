ðŸš€ Homelab Project: Certificate-based Local Gateway (CUBE) integration between Webex Calling and Twilio.

I recently built a full voice integration lab combining:  

ðŸ”¹ Cisco Catalyst 8000V as CUBE (Local Gateway)  
ðŸ”¹ Webex Calling (sandbox trial)  
ðŸ”¹ Twilio Elastic SIP Trunk (free account)  

The setup uses SIP/TLS and SRTP to ensure secure end-to-end communication between Webex Calling and the PSTN via Twilio.
