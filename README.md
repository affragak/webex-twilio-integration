ðŸš€ Homelab Project: Webex Calling with Certificate-based Local Gateway (CUBE)

I recently built a full voice integration lab combining:
ðŸ”¹ Cisco Catalyst 8000V as CUBE (Local Gateway)
ðŸ”¹ Webex Calling (sandbox trial)
ðŸ”¹ Twilio Elastic SIP Trunk (trial)

The setup uses SIP/TLS and SRTP to ensure secure end-to-end communication between Webex Calling and the PSTN via Twilio.
